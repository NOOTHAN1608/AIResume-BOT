# BotresumeAnalyize
<<<<<<< HEAD
I developed a Resume Analyzer web application using the (Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to automate the process of screening resumes against job descriptions. The application allows users to upload resumes and job descriptions in PDF or DOCX format. Using advanced parsing libraries, the text content is extracted from the uploaded files. The core of the project involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GROQ_API or similar AI models to analyze the resume content. The AI model compares the skills, experience, and qualifications mentioned in resumes with the requirements in the job descriptions. It then generates a relevance score to rank candidates based on how well they fit the job criteria. The frontend, built with React, displays the analysis results clearly, highlighting matched skills and providing detailed feedback. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, handles file uploads, communicates with the AI model, and sends the processed data to the frontend. This automated system significantly reduces the manual effort involved in shortlisting candidates and enhances hiring accuracy. The project demonstrates the integration of AI with traditional web development frameworks to solve real-world HR challenges.

Project Overview
This project is a Bot Resume Analyzer that uses modern web technologies and a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to streamline the process of evaluating job applications. It features a user-friendly frontend for inputting job descriptions and uploading resumes, coupled with a robust backend for processing and analysis.

Architecture
The application is structured into two main components:

Frontend
The frontend is built with Vite, offering a fast and efficient development experience. It provides a clean, responsive user interface that allows users to:

Enter job descriptions directly into a text area.
Upload multiple resume files (e.g., PDF, DOCX) simultaneously.
Display analysis results clearly.
The UI is styled using internal CSS for a cohesive design. The application runs locally via npm run dev.

Backend
The backend is powered by Node.js, providing the necessary server-side logic for processing. It integrates with an LLM (Large Language Model) via the GROQ API to perform intelligent resume analysis. This involves:

Receiving job descriptions and resume files from the frontend.
Extracting key information from resumes using NLP techniques.
Comparing resume content against job descriptions.
Leveraging the LLM for advanced understanding and matching of skills and experience.
Generating comprehensive analysis reports.
Note on GROQ API Usage: The GROQ API offers a free tier, which is sufficient for initial testing and demonstration. Please be aware of the 500-unit limit for free usage.

Key Features
Intelligent Resume Analysis: Utilizes an LLM for advanced understanding and scoring of resumes against specific job descriptions.
Multi-File Upload: Efficiently process multiple resumes in one go.
Intuitive User Interface: Easy-to-use frontend for seamless interaction.
Scalable Backend: Node.js ensures robust and responsive processing.
